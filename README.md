* HashiCorp Packer is an open-source tool that automates and standardizes the process of building machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration.
* It can create identical images for production, staging, QA, and development.
* Packer is lightweight and runs on every major operating system.
* can create images in parallel.
* So we will call Packer-made Images.

Benefits of Packer:

* Version Controlled         - Images are defined and versioned as code.
* Cross-Platform Consistency - When you use multiple platforms for workloads, maintaining similar images becomes a demanding task. Packer can assist with management across multiple platforms.
* Stop the manual madness    - Manually managing images across multiple platforms is prone to human error.
